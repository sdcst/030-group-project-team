please run "MAIN.py" in a terminal using your python interpreter.
other files, such as "settei", are only function sets.




kole made: main code core,  "settei" function set (which tell the main code core how to function, and calls modules),  chelp module,  triconpute,  rocket deltaV,  title,  patching other's code

cristal made:  area of a square module,  circumference module,  perimeter module,  GDP module

victoria made:  surface area module,  volume module,  tax module,  halflife module,  simpleinterest module,  compound interest module

(the above is not fully updated)

note: 
this program is modular by design; it works by containering it's functions, and calls the functions on demand; each function is self-isolated and does not interfere with the mainline code.
new "mini programs" can be easily added by modifying settei.selection to include it.
it is split up into 3 main parts:
the main code: the executable file, and tells which function to execute when.
settei module: a set of core functions that includes functions that recieve input, and tell modules when to execute
program modules: mini programs that get called by settei.selection; these are the programs that make up the calculator
